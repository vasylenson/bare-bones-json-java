# Jacey JSON parser in Java

Jacey is a simple and minimal JSON parser. It is a personal, mostly educational project that I like rewriting in different languages and paradigms. This repo contains the Java version of Jacey, aimed at exploring the language features and object-oriented design principles.

## Goals

### Explore

- the principles of OOP, GoF, GRASP design patterns
- see how OO paradigm works for parsers
- Java 
  - the language features, idiomatic Java code
  - Java standard library, interfaces, developing classes that integrate well with language features

### Create

- a fully functional (as in it works) and well-tested JSON library
- extensible and composable code
- a lightweight, zero-dependency library. that's both a practical goal and a nice challenge

## Non-goals

- **highest possible performance**. Performant patterns and idioms are still preferable, but this is a rather secondary criterion.
- **wide feature set**. new features will only be added if I consider them an interesting challenge or a useful thing to study
- **simplicity**. the complexity of code here is ridiculous and very unnecessary. Elegance and expressiveness in architecture are more of a primary goal, though. It's debatable whether this approach will result in a maintainable codebase, but I guess I'm about to find that out :D

## Contributing

I ainâ€™t got no way of knowing whether there is a force capable of moving somebody to contribute to this kind of project, but if you happen to be one such person, **you're more than welcome**. Any pull requests can be expected to be reviewed by me promptly.

### What you can do
- suggest corrections or optimizations
- suggest and/or implement even crazier ways to stretch the capabilities of Java and OOP
- extend the functionality (and I will try to make it as extensible as I can do) or even suggest features or tweaks to API to be implemented, to keep me busy :D
