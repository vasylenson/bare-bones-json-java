# Bare-Bones JSON in Java

A Java rendition of the *Bare-Bones JSON* project, which, ironically, is not really bare-bones as in having a restricted feature set, but rather as in only utilizing the bare-bones standard library of the language with no third-party dependencies.

## Purpose

This is a study. This is obvious from the fact of java already having a JSON parser in the standard distribution. Also, the architecture of the project is unnecessarily complicated, as can be seen in the [TODO file](TODO.md).

### Goals

- OOP principles, GoF, GRASP design patterns
- Java language features, idiomatic Java code
- Java standard library, interfaces, developing classes that integrate well with language features
- actually have a bit of fun and explore the paradigm and the platform

### Non-goals

- **highest possible performance**. Performant patterns and idioms are still preferable, but this is a rather secondary criterion.
- **simplicity**. the complexity of code here is ridiculous and very unnecessary. Elegance and expressiveness in architecture are more of a primary goal, though. It's debatable whether this approach will result in a maintainable codebase, but I guess I'm about to find that out :D

## Contributing

I ainâ€™t got no way of knowing whether there is a force capable of moving somebody to contribute to this kind of project, but if you happen to be one such person, **you're more than welcome**. Any pull requests can be expected to be reviewed by me promptly.

### What you can do
- suggest corrections or optimizations
- suggest and/or implement even crazier ways to stretch the capabilities of Java and OOP
- extend the functionality (and I will try to make it as extensible as I can do) or even suggest features or tweaks to API to be implemented, to keep me busy :D
